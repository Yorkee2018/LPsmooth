# The 'LPsmooth' R package
The LPsmooth package provides a R implementation for the smoothed inference and graphics by means of CD plots and deviance tests, proposed in S. Algeri, 2019. Simulations methods are used to perform variance estimation, inference and post-selection adjustments. 

Further details and theory about the algorithm can be found in the **"Algeri S., Zhang X. (2020+).  Smoothed inference and graphics via LP modeling.",** [[arXiv:2005.13011](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.13011.pdf)].
