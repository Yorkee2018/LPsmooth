# The 'LPsmooth' R package
The LPsmooth package provides a R implementation for the smoothed inference and graphics by means of CD plots and deviance tests, proposed in **Algeri S., Zhang X. (2020+)**. Simulations methods are used to perform variance estimation, inference and post-selection adjustments. 

Further details and theory about the algorithm can be found in the **"Smoothed inference and graphics via LP modeling.",** [[arXiv:2005.13011](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.13011.pdf)].

For more technical problems, please contact the maintainer of the package Xiangyu Zhang at zhan6004@gmail.com.
